                <h1>About InSciM Project</h1>

                <p>As the world undergoes profound transformations, science is highly solicited, such as in the context of health crises (Covid-19), the reflection and dialogue on climate change, ecological and energy transformations, monetary transformation, humanitarian issues, or geopolitical crises. The perception of uncertainty in scientific discourse is therefore an important issue for all scientific activities. In science, the production of new knowledge uses rigorous methodological approaches based on the object of study and its disciplinary field. However, the use of tools or observations that produce a margin of error, as well as the use of abductive and inductive reasoning imply the presence of uncertainty, which can be specific to each discipline, linked to the object of the study and the methodologies that are used. Uncertainty in science is an integral part of the research process.</p>

                <!-- <p>The ANR InSciM project aims to study uncertainty in science through ontological and linguistic modelling of this notion from datasets of articles in different disciplines. The objectives are to propose a linguistic model of the expression of uncertainty in scientific articles, in order to propose a tool to identify and classify these phenomena present in papers in different disciplines in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and in Science, Technology, and Medicine (STM). </p> -->
                <h3>Creating a linguistic model of scientific uncertainty and tools for its annotation in articles across disciplines</h3>

                <p>
                  The ANR InSciM project addresses the growing need to understand and model scientific
                  uncertainty in the context of major global transformations such as health crises (e.g.,
                  Covid-19), climate change, and geopolitical issues. Scientific uncertainty is inherent in
                  research processes across disciplines, stemming from the use of inductive and abductive
                  reasoning, methodological limits, and tools that introduce error margins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project's core objective is to create a linguistic model of uncertainty in scientific articles
                  across a range of disciplines, including Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and
                  Science, Technology, and Medicine (STM). This interdisciplinary approach will make
                  possible the development of Gold Standard annotated datasets, in order to build
                  knowledge-based approaches for annotation and to train machine learning and deep
                  learning models, ultimately leading to an automated tool capable of detecting and
                  categorising uncertainty in scientific discourse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to theoretical outcomes, this work will have societal impacts by improving the
                  dialogue between science, policy, and society. Understanding uncertainty in scientific
                  findings is crucial for informed decision-making, particularly in public policy debates related
                  to precautionary principles and scientific regulation. Thus, the tools developed in this
                  project will offer practical solutions for a better transparency and communication in
                  scientific discourse across various fields.
                </p>

                <h3>Methods and technologies used</h3>
                <p>
                  The ANR InSciM project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques,
                  linguistically-motivated tools and models, and machine learning to analyze scientific
                  uncertainty in scholarly texts. The approach begins with the creation of interdisciplinary
                  datasets composed of full-text scientific articles from disciplines in both Social Sciences
                  and Humanities (SSH) and Science, Technology, and Medicine (STM). These datasets are
                  analysed to identify linguistic patterns that express uncertainty by manual semantic
                  annotation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We propose a definition of the expression of uncertainty in scientific texts and a 5-
                  dimensional annotation scheme that accounts for the different types of uncertainty
                  expressed in articles. We produce annotated samples that serve as the foundation for
                  constructing a linguistic ontology of uncertainty, represented in OWL (Web Ontology Language) for easy sharing and querying. We also produce Gold Standard annotated
                  datasets in various disciplines.
                </p>

                <p>
                  An algorithm for the annotation of uncertainty is proposed using sets of linguistic patterns.
                  The annotated datasets are also used to produce language models of uncertainty. The
                  evaluation of both approaches is performed using precision, recall, and F-score metrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project also develops web interfaces that allow researchers to identify and efficiently
                  explore uncertainty in scholarly texts. These interfaces aim to facilitate interdisciplinary
                  research by providing tools for semantic search and extraction of uncertainty-related
                  information from scientific corpora.
                </p>

                <h3>Main results</h3>
                <p>
                  The ANR InSciM project has produced significant results that contribute to the
                  understanding and identification of scientific uncertainty across disciplines. The most
                  important results can be categorized into three main areas:
                </p>
                <p>
                 <b>1) Theoretical Results</b>: The project developed a comprehensive 5-dimensional
                  framework for the annotation of uncertainty, designed to reflect the various types of
                  uncertainty expressed in scientific articles across different disciplines. We propose also a
                  knowledge-based approach to the annotation of uncertainty in texts, base on sets of
                  linguistic patterns. The performance of this approach is compared with that of different
                  langage models obtained by deep learning techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>2) Practical Results</b>: One of the key outcomes of the project is the creation of Gold
                  Standard datasets, consisting of a large number of annotated sentences from scientific
                  articles from a wide range of disciplines. These datasets are manually annotated using our
                  annotation framework at the sentence level. These Gold Standard corpora will be made
                  available to the research community for training machine learning models and testing new
                  methods in NLP.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Building on these annotated datasets, the project proposed and evaluated knowledge-
                  based and deep learning approaches for the annotation of uncertainty. The
                  experimentation shows the robustness and scalability of the tools for the annotation of
                  uncertainty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to language models, the project develops semantic search interfaces that allow
                  researchers to explore uncertainty in large scientific corpora. Users can efficiently navigate
                  and extract information on uncertainty from interdisciplinary datasets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>3) Societal Contributions</b>: The project enhances the understanding of how uncertainty is
                  communicated in scientific research, for both researchers and the general public. The tools
                  and models developed as part of the project enable better analysis of scientific findings,
                  improving the dialogue between science, policymakers, and society. By making the tools
                  for detecting uncertainty available to the broader community, the project supports efforts to
                  bridge the gap between scientific expertise and public understanding, ultimately fostering
                  more informed decision-making processes.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Perspectives</h3>
                <p>
                  <b>Theoretical Advances</b>: The linguistic ontology of uncertainty developed through this
                  project provides a foundation for further research into the conceptualization and
                  formalization of uncertainty in scientific discourse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another area for exploration is the observation of the use of uncertainty in scientific
                  discourse from a disciplinary and diachronic point of view. Furthermore, uncertainty can be
                  considered in relation with other categories of information occurring in scientific discourse,
                  such as definitions or epistemic markers. Ultimately, we would be able to observe the
                  mechanisms behind the creation of new knowledge and the ways it is expressed in various
                  fields of research through the analysis of scientific corpora.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Practical Applications</b>: The tools and datasets developed in the project make possible a
                  variety of practical applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), information
                  retrieval, and scientometrics. Furthermore, the methods for uncertainty detection and
                  annotation could be adapted to other types of scientific discourse, such as grant
                  proposals, patents, and policy documents. The extension of the projectâs tools to these
                  areas could offer valuable insights for stakeholders in research funding, intellectual
                  property, and governance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The training of more sophisticated deep learning models is another key direction for future
                  development. As more annotated data becomes available, models could be fine-tuned to
                  achieve even higher levels of precision.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</b>: By making the annotated datasets, ontology, and tools
                  available to the broader research community, the project encourages cross-disciplinary
                  dialogue on how uncertainty is perceived and managed in different fields. Furthermore,
                  there is potential to expand the projectâs scope by collaborating with social scientists,
                  philosophers of science, and cognitive scientists to further investigate how uncertainty is
                  understood not just in scientific texts, but also in public communication, education, and
                  media. This could lead to new frameworks for teaching and disseminating scientific
                  knowledge, particularly in areas where uncertainty must be carefully communicated to
                  non-expert audiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Societal Impact</b>: One important perspective is the application of the projectâs tools to
                  enhance transparency in science communication. By identifying and categorizing
                  uncertainty in scientific publications, the project provides a mechanism for policymakers,
                  journalists, and the general public to better understand the limitations and confidence
                  levels of scientific findings. This could lead to more informed debates on pressing societal
                  issues such as climate change, pandemics, and technological innovation.

                    <img src="images/GESIS1.jpeg" class="col-md-5 float-left m-2 mt-4" style="max-width: 38%;" />

                    <p>We are excited to provide an update on the progress of InSciM project. Over the past three months, our PhD student, Panggih Kusuma Ningrum, had the invaluable opportunity to participate in a research visit program at GESIS â Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences in Germany. Under the guidance of Dr. Philipp Mayer, the esteemed team leader of the Information & Data Retrieval division at the GESIS department Knowledge Technologies for the Social Sciences (WTS), our collaboration focused on employing natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and analysis techniques to examine scientific uncertainty in the empirical social science domain. </p>

                    <img src="images/GESIS2.jpeg" class="col-md-5 float-right m-2 mt-4" style="max-width: 42%;" />

                    <p>During the program, we achieved significant milestones. Firstly, we successfully curated and annotated a comprehensive dataset in the field of empirical social science, providing a valuable resource for future studies in this area. Additionally, we developed the UnScientify app, a demonstrative interactive system designed to detect and analyze scientific uncertainty in scholarly full-text articles. This tool not only showcases our progress but also has the potential to aid researchers in understanding and addressing uncertainty in scientific literature. </p>

                    <p>Furthermore, we are delighted to announce that the research paper from this collaboration has been accepted for presentation at the Joint Workshop of the 4th Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE2023) and the 3rd AI + Informetrics (AII2023), which will be held as part of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2023 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, from June 26 to 30, 2023. This recognition not only validates the significance of our work but also provides an excellent platform to share our findings with the broader scientific community. </p>

                    <p>We extend our gratitude to Dr. Philipp Mayer and the team at GESIS for their invaluable support and collaboration. We are confident that our research project will contribute to advancing the understanding of scientific uncertainty and its implications in the empirical social science field.</p>


                    <h3 id="news1">Breaking News: Join Us at ISSI 2023 to Explore our Latest Research Findings!</h3>

                    <p>We are thrilled to announce that our research paper entitled "Investigating Uncertainty in Scholarly Articles: An Interdisciplinary Annotation Framework" has been accepted for presentation at the esteemed 19th International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI 2023) in Bloomington, Indiana, US. In this paper, we delve into the expression of uncertainty in academic articles and propose a novel interdisciplinary annotation framework that encompasses five dimensions for categorizing uncertain sentences. Through the analysis of a diverse corpus from various disciplines, we conduct experiments on two distinct sets of sentences: one obtained via uncertainty cue mapping and another through manual annotation of randomly selected articles. Our findings unveil the distribution of uncertainty types across journals and categories, while also highlighting the potential for automation in certain aspects of the annotation process. We are honored to share our research with the scholarly community at ISSI 2023 and look forward to engaging in insightful discussions on this crucial topic.</p>
